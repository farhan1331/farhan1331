#Try It Yourself
#Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save
#each program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions,
#using lowercase letters and underscores, such as simple_message.py and
#simple_messages.py.
#2-1. Simple Message: Store a message in a variable, and then print that
#message.
#2-2. Simple Messages: Store a message in a variable, and print that message.
#Then change the value of your variable to a new message, and print the new
#message.
